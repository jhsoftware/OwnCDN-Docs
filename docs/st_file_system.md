# File System (service type)

The File System service is used to serve files directly from disk (and uploading to disk files, etc.)

Note that forward slashes (`/`) in file paths are converted to backward slashes (`\`) to match the Windows file system.

See [UI / Edit Service - File System](es_file_system.md) for configuration options.
