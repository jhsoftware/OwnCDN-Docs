# UI / Services

The page show a list of all the configured services.

Click the "Name" and "Type" headers to sort the list according to service name or service type.

Click the pencil icon next to each service to edit that service.

Click a service name to go to the [Service status](service-status/index.md) page for that service.

Click the "+ New service" button to configure a new service.


## Group by source

When this option is checked, the service list is grouped according to source, so that services that are a source of another service is listed directly under that service (with an arrow-up icon indicating their relationship) - possibly in multiple levels.

Note that a service may be the source of multiple other services, and therefore may appear multiple times in the list when the "Group by source" option is enabled.
