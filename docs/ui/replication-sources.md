Replication sources are used with [Storage services](../service-types/storage.md) configured to be a replica.

Click the pencil icon next to a replication source  to edit it.

Click the "+ New Replication Source" button to create a new Replication Source.

Either action will open the [Edit Replication Source page](edit-replication-source.md).
